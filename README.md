# SurfaceViewExample

The SurfaceViewExample app lets you search for an Android image on a dark phone screen using a "flashlight."

    At app startup, the user sees a black screen with a white circle, the "flashlight."
    While the user drags their finger, the white circle follows the touch.
    When the white circle intersects with the hidden Android image, the screen lights up to reveal the complete image and a "win" message.
    When the user lifts their finger and touches the screen again, the screen turns black and the Android image is hidden in a new random location.
